- started soldering switch and fuse together
- attached battery cable as well
- before attaching battery, tried testing
- used small dc motor, no response
- used led, no response
- tried led on batteries themselves w/ resistor (like aaa batteries) and didn't work


todo:
- get a voltimeter to test the circuit for resistance etc (easiest way)
